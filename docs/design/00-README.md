# Friday — A Frappe-Derived Agentic Framework, Made in India

> **Tagline:** Enterprise agentic intelligence, governed by a Frappe-derived backbone — for Indian growing businesses, by Indian builders.

Friday is an open-source, Frappe-derived agentic framework that re-engineers proven agent patterns (Hermes by Nous Research, OpenClaw) into an enterprise application substrate. The goal is enterprise-grade agent governance — role-based permissions, audit trails, sandboxing, structured skill schemas — that today's agent frameworks lack out of the box.

**The mission:** every Indian SMB owner gets a back-office team that never sleeps, runs on their ERPNext, and operates within auditable boundaries.

## Quick Summary

**What Friday is:**
- A Frappe-derived agentic framework, made in India
- Re-implements Hermes/OpenClaw patterns inside a governed enterprise substrate
- Framework-first from day one: bench-aware Friday agent commands, Friday Control Room, agent-native primitives
- Turns Hermes-style multi-agent Kanban into flexible Frappe workflows: Kanban is a view, not the workflow
- Permission-first: every action gated through Frappe role matrix BEFORE queueing
- Audit-everything: every decision, escalation, skill call logged
- Multi-agent collaboration via Frappe Projects/Tasks + Raven War Rooms

**What Friday is not:**
- A fork of Hermes or OpenClaw
- A thin "AI app installed on Frappe" with no framework identity
- A proprietary product (open-source under GPL v3, with AGPL v3 under consideration for launch)
- Tied to a single LLM provider (provider-agnostic)
- Built only for tech-savvy users — built for SMB operators

**Core differentiators:**
1. Hermes and OpenClaw treat security as configuration; Friday treats it as a first-class architectural concern, inherited from Frappe's role and permission system.
2. Friday is Indian-built and India-first in design priorities (INR pricing, regional compliance, English + regional language ops).
3. The hosted FridayLabs SaaS splits net revenue with contributors via a transparent, public score (40/30/20/10 split).

**Phase 1 North Star:**
Friday proves the governed framework loop, then uses it for the ERPNext Purchase Order flagship dogfood. The order matters: first profile, skill, permission check, sandboxed execution, logs, task workflow, and Control Room; then PO automation on that foundation. See documents 19, 30, and 42.

## Document Status

All documents in this set are design specifications, not implementation manuals. They describe what Friday should be, how its parts fit together, and what trade-offs were considered. Implementation will inevitably surface details that require revisions; these documents will be updated as design contact with reality refines them.

Documents 39, 40, 41, 42, 06, 11, and 19 are the most operationally precise (framework strategy, gap resolution, porting strategy, Phase 1 authority, scope, validation, metrics). Documents 12 onward represent design depth that informs Phase 1 priorities but extends into Phase 2-4 as noted in each.

**Total content:** 42 design documents, ~9,000+ lines of markdown.

## Made In India 🇮🇳

Friday is built in India, for Indian growing businesses, by an Indian founder who believes the next great open-source enterprise framework should come from this side of the world. We're standing on the shoulders of Frappe (Mumbai), Raven (The Commit Company), and the global Hermes / OpenClaw communities — and adding the governance, accessibility, and economic alignment that the next chapter requires.
