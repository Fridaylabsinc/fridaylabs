# 14 — Integrated Architecture: Friday Framework + Frappe Substrate + Raven + ERPNext Project/Task + Hermes

> **Purpose:** Define how the foundational layers of Friday — **Frappe-derived framework substrate**, **Raven**, **ported ERPNext Project/Task/Issue**, and **Hermes' gateway/agent loop patterns** — fit together as one coherent system.

This document supersedes any earlier assumptions that Friday builds Project/Task/Issue from scratch or builds chat from scratch. The unified stack reuses battle-tested Frappe-ecosystem apps wherever possible and reserves custom code for what's genuinely new (the agentic layer).

---

## 1. The Four Layers

| Layer | Source | Role in Friday |
|---|---|---|
| **Friday Framework Core** | Frappe-derived source substrate | Foundation: DocTypes, permissions, workflows, real-time, scheduler, RQ, REST API, bench operations, Friday agent commands, control-room shell |
| **Raven** | `The-Commit-Company/raven` | Communication and War Room workspaces |
| **Project + Task + Issue** | Ported from `frappe/erpnext` | Orchestration backbone for multi-agent work |
| **Friday Core (Hermes-derived)** | New code, inspired by `NousResearch/hermes-agent` | Agent loop, gateway, skills, dispatcher, isolation |

Friday is the assembly point and product identity. Frappe remains the proven substrate, but Friday owns the framework experience. Upstream Frappe improvements are reviewed and selectively merged where they strengthen Friday's core.

---

## 2. Why This Composition

We arrived here by elimination, not assumption:

- **Chat from scratch?** Rejected — Raven already exists, is GPL-compatible, has Slack-grade UX, integrates with Frappe natively, supports document sharing and message actions. Building chat ourselves would be reinvention.
- **Project/Task from scratch?** Rejected — ERPNext's Project, Task, and Issue DocTypes are mature, support time tracking, dependencies, and Kanban natively. Porting (rather than depending on full ERPNext) keeps Friday self-contained while inheriting that maturity.
- **Hermes' backend?** Rejected — file-based skills, SQLite sessions, ad-hoc permissions don't meet enterprise requirements. The agent loop and skill ideas are kept; the storage and governance are replaced.
- **Hermes' fixed Kanban lifecycle?** Rejected — real business workflows need configurable states and transitions. Friday keeps durable coordination but renders Frappe Workflow states as Kanban columns.
- **Custom permission engine?** Rejected — Frappe's role-based system is mature and battle-tested. Friday extends it; it does not replace it.

The result: Friday focuses its custom engineering effort on the **agentic layer** — gateway, dispatcher, sandbox, permission gating — and reuses the rest.

## 3. Layer Responsibilities

### 3.1 Friday Framework Core (Frappe-Derived Foundation)

Owns:
- DocType schema and ORM
- Role-based permissions (foundation for Friday's gateway permission gate)
- Workflow engine (used for Task state machine and approval routing)
- Real-time pubsub (used by Raven, gateway, and Kanban live updates)
- Background workers / RQ (used for skill executions, dispatcher tick, curator)
- Scheduler (used for periodic jobs)
- REST API (used by agent containers and external integrations)
- User accounts and authentication (every Agent Profile links to a User)

Friday adds framework identity and agent-native extension points where needed:
- bench remains the operational CLI; Friday adds agent-facing command groups or wrappers
- Friday Control Room workspace defaults
- actor/trace context propagation for agent execution
- framework-level audit hooks where app hooks are insufficient
- agent-aware defaults for jobs, workflows, and execution logs

Core divergence must follow `39-friday-framework-strategy.md`: minimal, documented, and only when a module/app cannot safely provide the behavior.

### 3.2 Raven (Communication)

Owns:
- Channels (public / private)
- Direct messages
- Message reactions (custom emojis for agent status)
- File and image sharing
- Message Actions (right-click → create DocType)
- Document sharing with previews
- Timeline integration on Frappe documents

Friday adds:
- Auto-create one Raven Channel per Agent Project (the **War Room**)
- Auto-join the project's assigned Agent Profiles and supervisors
- Custom Message Actions: escalate, log decision, approve skill, import skill
- A standard emoji set indicating agent state (executing, blocked, completed, review)
- Hooks that surface critical agent events (permission denial, skill failure, escalation) as channel messages

### 3.3 Ported Project / Task / Issue (Orchestration)

Owns (after porting):
- `Agent Project` (renamed from ERPNext Project) — container for related agent tasks
- `Agent Task` (renamed from ERPNext Task) — unit of work, assignable to Agent Profile
- `Agent Issue` (renamed from ERPNext Issue) — blocker, escalation, or bug report
- Native Kanban view on Agent Task
- Native Gantt view on Agent Project
- Task dependencies and predecessor relationships
- Time tracking on tasks

Friday adds:
- `assigned_to_profile` field on Agent Task (linking to Agent Profile)
- `required_skills` table on Agent Task
- Workflow templates tuned for agentic execution; the default may be Pending → Assigned → Executing → Blocked → Review → Completed → Cancelled, but projects can define different states
- Dispatcher integration (claims unassigned tasks)
- Real-time event emission on state changes

The ported DocTypes are **not** ERPNext dependencies — they live inside the Friday app, are renamed to avoid name clashes if ERPNext is installed alongside, and are maintained by the Friday team going forward.

### 3.4 Friday Core (Agentic Layer)

Owns (this is the genuinely new code):
- `Agent Profile` DocType — links to a Frappe User, references an Agent Role Profile
- `Agent Role Profile` DocType — predefined bundles of roles + skill permissions
- `Skill` DocType — structured skill schema with dual storage (DB + file backup)
- `Execution Log` (submittable) — every skill invocation
- `Permission Decision Log` (submittable) — every permission check
- `Workflow Request` — approval routing for high-risk skills
- Gateway orchestrator service (long-running process)
- Dispatcher (scheduled job)
- Permission engine (gates every skill at runtime)
- Skill loader and cache
- Docker-based isolation runtime
- LLM provider adapters
- Platform message adapters (CLI in Phase 1; more in Phase 2)

---

## 4. End-to-End Request Flow (Integrated Stack)

A real example tracing through all four layers:

```
1. Supervisor opens the Frappe Desk
   → creates an Agent Project ("Customer Onboarding Sprint")
   → adds Tasks, each tagged with required_skills and target Agent Profiles

2. Frappe hook fires on Agent Project after_insert
   → Friday creates a Raven Channel named "war-room/customer-onboarding-sprint"
   → adds assigned Agent Profiles' linked Users to the channel
   → posts a pinned message with the project brief and emoji legend

3. Dispatcher (Frappe scheduled job, runs every 60s)
   → queries Agent Task where workflow_state is dispatchable AND assigned_to_profile is null
   → matches each task to eligible Agent Profile based on required_skills ⊆ profile's permitted skills
   → atomically claims the task: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
   → updates workflow_state='Assigned'
   → emits Frappe real-time event 'agent_task.assigned'

4. Gateway (listening on Redis pubsub)
   → receives 'agent_task.assigned'
   → posts a status update to the War Room: "@agent-name picked up task X 🚀"
   → spawns or routes to the agent's Docker container

5. Agent runs the agent loop
   → reads its system prompt + permitted skills (cached in Redis)
   → calls the LLM with skill definitions
   → LLM emits a tool call → e.g. send_welcome_email(customer_id=...)

6. Permission engine gates the call (BEFORE any execution)
   → loads matrix from Redis (cache hit on warm path)
   → verifies the agent's role permits Email + write
   → logs a Permission Decision Log row (submitted)
   → on allow: proceeds. On deny: rejects with reason and posts ❌ in War Room

7. Skill executes inside Docker
   → container calls Frappe REST API with scoped token
   → Email DocType row is created
   → result returned to gateway as JSON

8. Gateway records the outcome
   → submits an Execution Log row
   → updates the Agent Task state machine (e.g. → Review or → Completed)
   → posts a status update in War Room ("Task X completed ✅" with link to Email document)

9. Raven Timeline integration
   → the message is pushed to the Agent Task's Frappe Timeline
   → the project record now shows the full conversation as audit history

10. Supervisor reviews
    → opens the War Room or the Agent Task
    → right-clicks on the agent's "completed" message
    → uses Raven Message Action "Approve & close task"
    → action creates / updates the Task to workflow_state='Completed'
```

Every step is auditable. Every step is permission-checked. Every step is queryable from Frappe.

## 5. Data Model Map

How DocTypes relate across the four layers:

```
User (Frappe)
  ↑ linked_user
Agent Profile (Friday)
  ↓ uses
Agent Role Profile (Friday) ──── grants ────→ Roles (Frappe)
                                              ↓ permit
                                              DocTypes (Frappe + ported)

Agent Project (ported ERPNext)
  ↓ has many
Agent Task (ported ERPNext + Friday fields)
  ↓ has many
  • Execution Log (Friday)
  • Permission Decision Log (Friday)
  • Workflow Request (Friday)
  • Raven Channel (one per project → War Room)
  • Raven Messages (in that channel)

Skill (Friday, dual storage)
  ↓ referenced by
Agent Task.required_skills (link table)
Agent Profile.permitted_skills (link table)
```

---

## 6. Dual-Storage Skills (DocType + File)

Skills live in two places:

1. **Authoritative for governance:** `Skill` DocType in PostgreSQL — queryable, permission-aware, audit-trailed.
2. **Authoritative for portability and DR:** A file in a Friday-managed directory (`{site}/private/files/skills/{skill_name}.json` or `.yaml`).

Sync rules:
- DocType save → write file (post-commit hook).
- File change detected (manual edit or git pull) → flagged for human review in a `Skill Sync Conflict` DocType, never auto-imported.
- Import flow: validate file → create/update DocType via the standard insert path so permissions and hooks fire.

**Why both?**
- Files are portable: easy to share across teams, version in Git, distribute through the Friday community.
- DocTypes are governable: permission checks, audit, status flags, usage metrics.
- They back each other up: a corrupted database row can be restored from file; a deleted file can be regenerated from the DocType.

**⚠️ Engineering Note — to refine later:**
Caching strategy still needs depth. Open questions:
- Where does the gateway read skills from on the hot path — Redis cache (populated from DocType) or Redis cache (populated from file)?
- How do we resolve concurrent edits to the same skill from two channels (Desk edit + Git pull)?
- What's the conflict-resolution UI for `Skill Sync Conflict` rows?
- Should the file format be JSON, YAML, or markdown-with-frontmatter (Hermes-style)?

These need a deeper engineering pass before Slice 3 of Phase One implementation. **Marked as a TODO; conceptually agreed; deferred to a dedicated design spike.**

---

## 7. Frappe File Manager Integration

Friday uses Frappe's built-in File DocType and file manager for:

- **Skill file storage** — under `private/files/skills/`, permission-aware.
- **Execution attachments** — agents may produce files (PDFs, images, transcripts); they're attached to Execution Log rows via the File DocType.
- **Skill import/export bundles** — collections of skills exported as a single zip/tar for distribution.
- **War Room file sharing** — Raven already wraps Frappe's file system; uploads there inherit the same permissions and lifecycle.

No custom file storage layer needed. Frappe's permissions on the File DocType govern who can read/write each artifact.

---

## 8. Skill Import / Export Pipeline

### Export
1. Supervisor selects one or more `Skill` rows in Friday.
2. Triggers "Export Skills" action.
3. Friday packages them as a zip containing:
   - One JSON/YAML file per skill (full schema)
   - A `manifest.json` with version, author, license (GPL v3 by default)
   - Optional README
4. File is saved to Frappe's File Manager, downloadable via REST.

### Import
1. Supervisor uploads a skill bundle (zip or single file).
2. Friday parses the manifest, validates each skill against the JSON schema.
3. For each skill:
   - Check if a Skill with the same name exists.
   - If yes → create a `Skill Draft` for review (never silent overwrite).
   - If no → create as `Skill` with `status='Experimental'`.
4. Supervisor reviews drafts in the Desk, promotes to Active when satisfied.
5. Audit log records who imported what, when, from where.

**Human intervention is mandatory at:**
- Conflict resolution (existing skill vs imported skill)
- Promotion from Experimental → Active
- Deletion of any Active skill (grace period via Retire → Archive → Delete flow)

---

## 9. War Room Workspace (Project Hub)

The War Room is not just a chat channel — it's the project's command center.

**Components:**
| Element | Backed by |
|---|---|
| Real-time conversation | Raven channel |
| Active task list | Frappe List View on Agent Task filtered by project |
| Kanban board | Frappe Kanban View on Agent Task |
| Agent status panel | Custom Vue component, reads Agent Profile + recent Execution Logs |
| Document feed | Raven document sharing |
| Quick action buttons | Raven Message Actions + Frappe form actions |
| Pinned project brief | Raven pinned message |
| Audit timeline | Frappe Timeline on Agent Project |

**Composition pattern:** a Frappe Workspace (the v16 redesigned workspace) configured for each Agent Project, pulling Raven channel embed, Kanban, list view, and custom panels into one screen.

---

## 10. Hermes Mapping (What Stays, What Goes)

| Hermes piece | Verdict in integrated stack |
|---|---|
| AIAgent loop | ADAPT — keep loop, replace state plumbing |
| Prompt builder | ADAPT — replace file reads with DocType reads |
| Skill markdown system | REWRITE — replaced by Skill DocType + file mirror |
| Kanban dashboard | REWRITE — replaced by Frappe Workflow + Kanban View on Agent Task |
| Platform adapters | ADAPT for CLI (Phase 1); Raven becomes the "chat platform" for human interaction |
| Cron / scheduler | REWRITE — replaced by Frappe Scheduler |
| Session storage (SQLite + FTS5) | REWRITE — replaced by PostgreSQL + tsvector |
| Approval routing | REWRITE — replaced by Frappe Workflow + Raven Message Actions |
| Memory / vector | REWRITE — replaced by pgvector (Phase 2) |
| Tirith command scanner | REUSE as external dependency (Phase 2) |
| LLM provider abstraction | REUSE pattern, build minimal version Phase 1 |
| Inter-agent dispatching | REWRITE — replaced by dispatcher querying Agent Task |

Hermes is now best understood as a **reference implementation of the agentic ideas**, not a codebase to fork. Friday is a fresh implementation of those ideas on the Frappe + Raven + ported-ERPNext substrate.

The specific Hermes Kanban lesson is captured in `41-porting-strategy-hermes-erpnext-raven.md`: agents may propose profiles, skills, tasks, and workflows, but they do not silently activate safety-critical structure. Validated DocTypes and Frappe Workflow own the operating model.

---

## 11. Phase Mapping Update

This integrated architecture refines the Phase One scope as follows. Where this document conflicts with `39-friday-framework-strategy.md`, the framework strategy wins for product identity and fork discipline.

**Phase 1 (unchanged scope, clarified dependencies):**
- Establish Friday Framework shell from selected Frappe source substrate
- Preserve bench for operations; add Friday-facing agent commands and Friday Control Room workspace
- Install Raven (used for War Room from day one)
- Port Agent Project, Agent Task, Agent Issue from ERPNext into Friday app
- Build Friday core: Agent Profile, Agent Role Profile, Skill (with file mirror), Execution Log, Permission Decision Log, Workflow Request
- Implement gateway, dispatcher, permission engine, Docker isolation
- CLI adapter for direct agent interaction
- One real skill (`create_note`) end-to-end with War Room status updates

**Phase 2 (additions to scope):**
- Additional platform adapters (Telegram, Slack, etc.) alongside Raven
- Memory module with pgvector
- Skill import/export pipeline
- Voice, vision, browser automation
- Tirith integration
- v16 migration (if Phase 1 was on v15)

---

## 12. Engineering TODOs Captured Here

The following items have conceptual agreement but require dedicated engineering design spikes before implementation:

| TODO | Rationale | Suggested Owner / Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Skill DocType ↔ file sync strategy and conflict resolution UI | Hybrid system needs concrete semantics | Phase 1, week 3 design spike |
| Skill cache: file-vs-DocType source of truth on hot path | Performance vs governance tradeoff | Phase 1, week 3 design spike |
| War Room channel archive / retention policy | Aligning Raven retention with Frappe lifecycle | Phase 2 |
| Concurrency between Raven message stream and Execution Log writes | Avoiding torn audit trails | Phase 1, slice 8 |
| Fine-grained Message Action permissions in Raven | Restrict who can trigger which action | Phase 2 |
| Agent Role Profile schema details (inherits Frappe Role Profile?) | Need to test whether Frappe Role Profile is sufficient or we need a new DocType | Phase 1, slice 1 design spike |
| ERPNext port: which fields to drop, which to keep | Avoid carrying ERP-specific clutter | Phase 1, slice 1 |

These TODOs are noted explicitly to prevent silent guesses during implementation. The agent following the Execution Guide should treat each as a blocker and produce a design proposal before proceeding.

---

## 13. Summary

Friday is the **assembly** of:

- **Friday Framework Core** for the Frappe-derived data, permission, workflow, bench operations, Friday agent commands, workspace, and real-time substrate
- **Raven** for human-agent and agent-agent collaboration via War Rooms
- **Ported Project / Task / Issue** for orchestration scaffolding
- **Friday Core** for the agentic layer (gateway, dispatcher, skills, isolation, permission gate)

This is an **integrated architecture record**. The framework-first direction in `39-friday-framework-strategy.md` is the higher-level product identity record.
